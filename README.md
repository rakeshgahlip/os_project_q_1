The inputs for the number of requirements, arrival time and burst time should be
provided by the user.
Consider the following units for reference.
Process Arrival time Burst time
P1 0 20
P2 5 36
P3 13 19
P4 26 42
Develop a scheduler which submits the processes to the processor in the defined scenario,
and compute the scheduler performance by providing the waiting time for process,
turnaround time for process and average waiting time and turnaround time.
